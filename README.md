### HOW TO RUN:
<a href = "http://WalidF123.github.io/FullStack-Site">"Click here to go to my site"</a>

# OPERATION:
BACKEND:
 - Is deployed on render so can handle any calls to the API

FRONTEND:
- The react app is hosted on github pages

# Helpful Information
- In long periods of inactivity render spinds down the backend deployment so some calls to the API may take up to a minute
 - So for example when trying to add a product to the cart it may take a minute to add due to render.
